I‚Äôm Sachin, a Technical Lead at We Make Platforms based in Sri Lanka.\n\nI‚Äôm passionate about turning creative ideas into real, working web experiences. My focus is on building scalable, user-friendly frontend applications with Angular, where my goal is to design products that not only look great but also feel smooth and intuitive to use.\n\nI started my career as a Trainee Associate Software Engineer and grew into senior roles, where I sharpened both my coding and leadership skills. As a Senior Software Engineer, I led the development of key features that significantly boosted user engagement‚Äîseeing those improvements make a real difference was one of my proudest career moments. One project I‚Äôm especially proud of was delivering high-performance REST APIs for a Jira ticketing system under tight deadlines. It challenged me to balance speed and quality, and it strengthened my ability to thrive under pressure.\n\nBeyond work, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to create seamless, responsive user experiences.\n\nI believe in continuous learning and sharing knowledge to grow together in this fast-moving tech world. When I‚Äôm not coding, you‚Äôll often find me exploring creative ideas, keeping up with the latest in frontend trends, or experimenting with design. üöÄ"
