        <p class="about">
          Hi there ‚úåÔ∏è nice to meet you! I‚Äôm Sachin, an Associate Technical Lead at
          <b><a href="https://www.wemakeplatforms.io/" target="_blank">We Make Platforms</a></b>
          based in Sri Lanka. <br /><br />
          I‚Äôm passionate about turning creative ideas into real, working web experiences. My focus
          is on building scalable, user-friendly frontend applications with Angular, where my goal
          is to design products that not only look great but also feel smooth and intuitive to use.
          I started my career as a Trainee Associate Software Engineer and grew into senior roles,
          where I sharpened both my coding and leadership skills. As a Senior Software Engineer, I
          led the development of key features that significantly boosted user engagement‚Äîseeing
          those improvements make a real difference was one of my proudest career moments. One
          project I‚Äôm especially proud of was delivering high-performance REST APIs for a Jira
          ticketing system under tight deadlines. It challenged me to balance speed and quality, and
          it strengthened my ability to thrive under pressure. Beyond work, I enjoy exploring new
          technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and collaborating with
          cross-functional teams to create seamless, responsive user experiences. <br /><br />
          I believe in continuous learning and sharing knowledge to grow together in this
          fast-moving tech world. When I‚Äôm not coding, you‚Äôll often find me exploring creative
          ideas, keeping up with the latest in frontend trends, or experimenting with design. üöÄ
